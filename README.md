# Requirements Analysis Document

## Document Instructions
This document template contains directions for use or sample entries. These directions are enclosed in brackets ( ) and are italicized. They are included to help you fill out the form. As you complete the form, delete these instructions. 

Please follow this document naming convention to facilitate document search and retrieval:

project code (if appropriate) project name (abbreviated) document name (abbreviated) version (if appropriate)

All documents should be posted to the appropriate project folder in SharePoint. 



## Purpose

The results of the requirements elicitation and the analysis activities are documented in the Requirements Analysis Document (RAD). This document completely describes the system in terms of functional and nonfunctional requirements and serves as a contractual basis between the customer and the developer. The RAD must be written in the language of the customer's domain of business/expertise. Under no circumstances should any "computerese" terminology creep into this document.

## Audience

The audience for the RAD includes the customer, the users, the project management, the system analysts (i.e., the developers who participate in the requirements), and the system designers (i.e., the developers who participate in the system design). The first part of the document, including use cases and nonfunctional requirements, is written during requirements elicitation. The formalization of the specification in terms of object models is written during analysis. We use an example template for a RAD introduced in the book.

## Template

### Section/Topic and Description
1. **Introduction**  
    1.1 Purpose of the system  
    1.2 Scope of the system  
    1.3 Objectives and success criteria of the project  
    1.4 Definitions, acronyms, and abbreviations  
    1.5 References  
    1.6 Overview	 
    

    The first section of the RAD is an Introduction. Its purpose is to provide a brief overview    
    of the function of the system and the reasons for its development, its scope, and references  
    to the development context (e.g., reference to the problem statement written by the client,  
    references to existing systems, feasibility studies).  
    The introduction also includes the objectives and success criteria of the project.
 
2. **Current system**  	
	The second section, Current system, describes the current state of affairs. If the new system will replace an existing system, this section describes the functionality and the problems of the current system. Otherwise, this section describes how the tasks supported by the new system are accomplished now.  

	Describe the current environment in detail to help identify and support the needs and goals described in the previous section.  Consider the following list of questions to help define the current environment  
	What are the current problems faced (without the system) today?   
	What problems should this system solve?  
	Do you have to do things manually that you would like to automate?  
	Do you have performance problems that need to change?  
	Do you have functional limitations that you would like to change?  
	Are you using packages that force you to constrain your business functionality to the boundaries of the package?  
  
3. **Proposed system**  
	The third section documents the requirements elicitation and the analysis model of the new system.  
   
    3.1 Overview  	
    The overview presents a functional overview of the system.  
     In this section, provide a summary describing the approach, methods, and documentation of the business requirements, including: project drivers, key project stakeholders, main functions that will be performed by the system, and a general requirements documentation timeline.  

   
    3.2 Functional requirements ("shall lists")  
        3.2.1  
        3.2.2   
        3.2.3   
        3.2.4   
		
		Functional requirements describes the high-level functionality of the system.  
 
    3.3 Nonfunctional requirements  
        3.3.1 Usability  
        3.3.2 Reliability  
        3.3.3 Performance  
        3.3.4 Supportability  
        3.3.5 Implementation  
        3.3.6 Interface  
        3.3.7 Packaging  
        3.3.8 Legal	  

        Nonfunctional requirements describes user-level requirements that are not directly  
        related to functionality. This includes usability, reliability, performance,  
        supportability, implementation, interface, operational, packaging, and legal requirements.
 
    3.4 System models  
        3.4.1 Scenarios  
        3.4.2 Use case model  
        3.4.3 Analysis object model  
        3.4.4 Dynamic model  
        3.4.5 User interface—navigational paths and screen mock-ups	  
  
        System models describes the scenarios, use cases, object model, and dynamic models for the system.  
        This section contains the complete functional specification, including mock-ups illustrating  
        the user interface of the system and navigational paths representing the sequence of screens. 
        The subsections Object model and Dynamic model are written during the Analysis activity.  

    3.5 References/Inputs  
	Identify the sources of information/reference materials that were used to develop the Requirements Plan, such as:   
     	1. Author name, title, and publication date.  
    	2. Author name, title, and publication date.  
  
4. **Glossary**  	
	A glossary of important terms, to ensure consistency in the specification and to ensure that we use the client’s terms. A precurser to the Data Dictionary
